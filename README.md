# Advent Of Code 2020
This repo contains my solutions for the ongoing Advent of Code 2020 challenges. I will probably be programming them in Ruby, though if I'm late I might try something more draconian just for fun (perhaps Rust, which I've barely used it before, or C, because I hate myself, or Python, because I would like to gain experience in that).

You can learn all about the AOC [here](https://adventofcode.com).
