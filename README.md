# Advent Of Code 2020
This repo contains my solutions for the ongoing Advent of Code 2020 challenges. I have been programming them in Ruby so far, though I may switch to something else at any moment.

**Note my solutions here are not meant to be perfect!** In terms of performance, some of them are pretty awful. My goal is to get to the answer, and I try to do it using the most reasonable way I can think of on the spot. Sometimes I arrive to my solution rather weird ways, but this is fine to me. Again, I'm not concerned with making the best solutions here, but just what works. I'm only doing these for fun and for practice.

You can learn all about the AOC [here](https://adventofcode.com).

Note that any solutions involving graphs need Graphviz installed to show the image. You can learn how to download and install it [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/).
